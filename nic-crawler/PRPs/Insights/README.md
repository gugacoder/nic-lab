# Insights

This directory contains evolving ideas, investigations, studies, and brainstorming sessions. These are not yet formal proposals but rather exploratory content that may eventually develop into structured project requirements.

## Overview

The Insights directory serves as a repository for:
- Initial brainstorming sessions
- Research findings and investigations
- Experimental concepts and prototypes
- Technical feasibility studies
- Market research and user feedback analysis

## Content Types

### Research & Investigation
- Technical research documents
- Feasibility studies
- Competitive analysis
- User research findings

### Ideation & Brainstorming
- Concept sketches and wireframes
- Feature idea collections
- Problem identification notes
- Solution exploration documents

### Experimental Work
- Proof-of-concept implementations
- Technical spikes and prototypes
- Performance testing results
- Integration experiments

## Evolution Process

Ideas in this directory typically follow this evolution path:

1. **Initial Insight**: Raw ideas, observations, or identified opportunities
2. **Investigation**: Research and analysis to validate the concept
3. **Refinement**: Iterative development of the idea with more detail
4. **Proposal Ready**: Structured enough to move to `/Proposals` directory

## Usage Guidelines

- Use descriptive filenames that indicate the nature of the insight
- Include dates in document headers to track evolution
- Link related insights and reference external sources
- Update documents as understanding develops
- Move mature concepts to the Proposals directory when ready

## Organization

Files are organized by topic areas or project domains, with each insight document containing metadata about its current stage and next steps.
