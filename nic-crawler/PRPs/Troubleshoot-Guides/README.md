# Troubleshoot-Guides

This directory contains structured troubleshooting documentation for common issues and their proven resolutions. These guides enable systematic problem-solving and can be automatically applied through the Claude Code command system.

## Overview

The Troubleshoot-Guides directory serves as a knowledge base for:

- Documented issues with comprehensive descriptions
- Step-by-step resolution procedures
- Multiple solution approaches when applicable
- Proven troubleshooting methodologies

## Usage

### Generating New Troubleshoot Guides

To create a new troubleshooting guide:

1. **Open Claude Code**:

   ```bash
   claude
   ```

2. **Execute the generation command**:

   ```bash
   /PRPs:generate-troubleshoot {issue-description}
   ```

This will create a new guide following the template structure and sequential numbering system.

### Applying Existing Solutions

To execute a documented resolution:

1. **Open Claude Code**:

   ```bash
   claude
   ```

2. **Execute the troubleshoot command**:

   ```bash
   /PRPs:execute-troubleshoot {guide-number|filename|keyword}
   ```

Examples:

- `/PRPs:execute-troubleshoot 1`
- `/PRPs:execute-troubleshoot librechat-role`
- `/PRPs:execute-troubleshoot 01-When-librechat-role-not-found.md`

## File Structure

Each troubleshooting guide follows the standardized structure defined in `.templates/template-troubleshoot.md`. The template ensures consistency across all troubleshooting documentation and provides a clear framework for documenting issues and their resolutions.

## Naming Convention

Files are named using the following pattern:

```text
{sequential-number}-When-{short-description}.md
```

- **Sequential numbering**: 01, 02, 03, etc.
- **Descriptive title**: Concise description after "When"
- **Kebab-case formatting**: Use hyphens for word separation

Examples:

- `01-When-librechat-role-not-found.md`
- `02-When-docker-container-fails-to-start.md`
- `03-When-database-connection-timeout.md`

## Content Guidelines

### Issue Documentation

- Provide comprehensive problem descriptions
- Include error messages and symptoms
- Specify environmental conditions when relevant
- Note prerequisite conditions or system states

### Resolution Documentation

- Write clear, step-by-step instructions
- Include specific commands and code snippets
- Document multiple approaches when available
- Provide verification steps to confirm resolution

### Organization Principles

- Each guide addresses a specific, well-defined issue
- Solutions are tested and proven effective
- Documentation is kept current and accurate
- Cross-references to related guides when applicable

## Integration with Command System

This directory integrates with two Claude Code commands:

1. **generate-troubleshoot.md**: Creates new troubleshooting guides
2. **execute-troubleshoot.md**: Applies documented resolutions automatically

The command system enables both human reference and automated problem resolution, making troubleshooting more efficient and consistent.

## Evolution and Maintenance

- Update guides when new solutions are discovered
- Archive obsolete guides when issues are permanently resolved
- Cross-reference related troubleshooting scenarios
- Maintain accurate sequential numbering for new additions
