## Context

Task templates require advanced metadata capabilities that capture complex implementation relationships, dependency tracking, validation requirements, and progress indicators essential for sophisticated task management. This task improves existing task templates with enhanced frontmatter structures, relationship tracking mechanisms, validation integration, and progress monitoring capabilities.

## Relationships

### Implements Feature

- **[[Advanced Templates Framework.md]]**: Provides improved task templates with advanced metadata and relationship tracking capabilities

### Impacts Domains

- **[[Template Design.md]]**: Enhanced with advanced metadata design principles and relationship tracking approaches
- **[[Semantic Relationships.md]]**: Task templates will utilize semantic relationship types for more precise dependency and relationship management

## Implementation

### Required Actions

1. Enhance task template frontmatter with advanced relationship tracking including dependency chains, impact analysis, and semantic relationship types
2. Integrate validation checkpoints with automated quality checking, acceptance criteria validation, and progress verification mechanisms
3. Add progress monitoring capabilities including milestone tracking, completion indicators, and dependency status reporting
4. Implement relationship visualization support enabling clear representation of task relationships and dependency networks

### Files to Modify/Create

- **Upgrade**: /PRPs/System/Templates/task-template.md - Enhance with advanced metadata, relationship tracking, and validation integration
- **Update**: /PRPs/Domains/Template Design.md - Document advanced metadata design principles and relationship tracking approaches
- **Create**: /PRPs/System/Advanced Task Template Guide.md - Dedicated guide for leveraging enhanced task template capabilities

### Key Implementation Details

- Apply semantic relationship types from Task 05 to enable precise relationship classification and dependency tracking
- Integrate quality assurance validation from Task 18 to embed automated quality checking into task template workflow
- Build upon template design patterns from [[Template Design.md]] to ensure metadata enhancements maintain template usability

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Task template frontmatter enhanced with comprehensive relationship tracking including dependency chains and semantic relationship types
- [ ] Validation checkpoints integrated with automated quality checking and acceptance criteria validation mechanisms
- [ ] Progress monitoring capabilities implemented including milestone tracking and dependency status reporting
- [ ] Relationship visualization support added enabling clear representation of task networks and dependency relationships
- [ ] Enhanced templates maintain simplicity for basic tasks while providing advanced capabilities for complex implementation scenarios
- [ ] Template usage guide created demonstrating effective use of advanced metadata and relationship tracking features

## Validation

### Verification Steps

1. Apply enhanced task templates to complex implementation scenarios with multiple dependencies and validate relationship tracking effectiveness
2. Test validation integration with task completion workflows to verify automated quality checking and progress verification
3. Verify progress monitoring provides clear visibility into task status and dependency resolution without overwhelming users

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Verify task template enhancement
grep -r "relationship.*tracking\|dependency.*chain\|validation.*integration" PRPs/System/Templates/task-template.md

# Check template design integration
grep -r "advanced.*metadata\|relationship.*tracking" PRPs/Domains/Template\ Design.md

# Validate advanced task template guide creation
test -f "PRPs/System/Advanced Task Template Guide.md" && echo "Advanced task template guide created"
```

### Success Indicators

- Enhanced task templates provide 60% better relationship tracking and dependency management compared to original templates
- Validation integration successfully automates quality checking reducing manual validation overhead while improving compliance
- Progress monitoring enables clear task status visibility and dependency resolution tracking without adding complexity burden
