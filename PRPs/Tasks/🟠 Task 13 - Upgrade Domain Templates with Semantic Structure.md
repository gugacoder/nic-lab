## Context

Domain templates require semantic enrichment to capture the complex relationships, hierarchical structures, and contextual information that characterize modern knowledge organization. This task upgrades existing domain templates with enhanced metadata integration, semantic relationship fields, pattern recognition elements, and adaptive components that enable more comprehensive and useful domain documentation.

## Relationships

### Implements Feature

- **[[Advanced Templates Framework.md]]**: Provides semantically enhanced domain templates that form the foundation of the advanced template framework

### Impacts Domains

- **[[Template Design.md]]**: Enhanced with semantic template design principles and metadata integration approaches
- **[[AI Context Engineering.md]]**: Domain templates will incorporate AI optimization elements for improved comprehension

## Implementation

### Required Actions

1. Enhance domain template frontmatter with semantic relationship metadata including relationship types, weighting, and contextual hints
2. Upgrade domain content structure with pattern recognition elements and reusable knowledge components
3. Integrate adaptive template components that adjust section depth and detail based on domain complexity and usage context
4. Add AI optimization elements including structured markup, hierarchical organization, and pattern templates

### Files to Modify/Create

- **Upgrade**: /PRPs/System/Templates/domain-template.md - Enhance with semantic structures, metadata integration, and adaptive components
- **Update**: /PRPs/Domains/Template Design.md - Document semantic template design principles and enhancement patterns
- **Create**: /PRPs/System/Semantic Domain Template Guide.md - Dedicated guide for using enhanced domain templates effectively

### Key Implementation Details

- Apply semantic relationship types from Task 05 to enhance frontmatter with meaningful relationship metadata
- Integrate AI context engineering principles from Task 09 to optimize template structure for AI comprehension
- Build upon template design patterns from [[Template Design.md]] to ensure enhanced templates maintain usability and consistency

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Domain template frontmatter enhanced with comprehensive semantic relationship metadata and contextual hints
- [ ] Domain content structure upgraded with pattern recognition elements and reusable knowledge component frameworks
- [ ] Adaptive template components implemented adjusting section depth and detail based on domain complexity and context
- [ ] AI optimization elements integrated including structured markup and hierarchical organization optimized for AI processing
- [ ] Enhanced templates maintain backward compatibility with existing domain content while enabling semantic enrichment
- [ ] Template usage guide created providing clear instructions for leveraging enhanced semantic capabilities

## Validation

### Verification Steps

1. Apply enhanced domain templates to existing domains and validate improved semantic representation and metadata capture
2. Test adaptive template components with varying domain complexity levels to verify appropriate section adjustment
3. Verify AI optimization elements provide measurable improvements in AI comprehension and processing of domain content

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Verify domain template enhancement
grep -r "semantic.*relationship\|metadata.*integration\|adaptive.*component" PRPs/System/Templates/domain-template.md

# Check template design integration
grep -r "semantic.*template\|template.*enhancement" PRPs/Domains/Template\ Design.md

# Validate semantic template guide creation
test -f "PRPs/System/Semantic Domain Template Guide.md" && echo "Semantic domain template guide created"
```

### Success Indicators

- Enhanced domain templates capture 50% more semantic relationship information compared to original templates
- Adaptive template components successfully adjust to domain complexity providing appropriate detail levels without overwhelming users
- AI optimization elements enable 25% better AI comprehension and processing of domain template content
