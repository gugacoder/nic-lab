## Context

AI-optimized context assembly requires fundamental principles that align information architecture with AI processing patterns, cognitive load limitations, and comprehension optimization. This task establishes core AI context engineering principles including information sequencing, cognitive load management, pattern recognition enhancement, and inference support that maximize AI understanding and task execution effectiveness.

## Relationships

### Implements Feature

- **[[AI Context Optimization.md]]**: Provides foundational AI context engineering principles that enable the entire context optimization framework

### Impacts Domains

- **[[AI Context Engineering.md]]**: Primary domain enhanced with comprehensive context engineering principles and optimization strategies
- **[[Template Design.md]]**: Context engineering principles will inform AI-optimized template design and structure

## Implementation

### Required Actions

1. Document information sequencing principles including dependency-first ordering, general-to-specific progression, and problem-solution pairing
2. Establish cognitive load management strategies including chunk optimization, context window efficiency, and attention focus techniques
3. Create pattern recognition enhancement approaches structuring information to leverage AI pattern matching capabilities
4. Define inference support mechanisms providing clear causal chains, explicit relationships, and reasoning scaffolds for AI comprehension
