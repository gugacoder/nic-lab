## Context

Complex knowledge domains require systematic decomposition approaches to break them into manageable, focused components while maintaining coherent relationships and enabling effective context assembly. This task establishes comprehensive guidelines for analyzing complex domains and decomposing them using various strategic approaches based on functional, technical, user-centric, and process-oriented patterns.

## Relationships

### Implements Feature

- **[[Enhanced Methodology System.md]]**: Provides domain decomposition strategies that enable systematic methodology application to complex knowledge areas

### Impacts Domains

- **[[Knowledge Organization.md]]**: Enhanced with systematic domain decomposition methodologies and strategic frameworks
- **[[Template Design.md]]**: Decomposition guidelines will inform template structures for different domain complexity levels

## Implementation

### Required Actions

1. Document functional decomposition strategies for breaking domains by capabilities, features, and operational boundaries
2. Create technical decomposition approaches organizing domains by implementation layers, technologies, and system components
3. Establish user-centric decomposition methods structuring domains around user goals, workflows, and interaction patterns
4. Define process decomposition frameworks organizing domains by business processes, operational workflows, and procedural sequences

### Files to Modify/Create

- **Enhance**: /PRPs/Domains/Knowledge Organization.md - Add comprehensive domain decomposition strategies section with decision frameworks
- **Update**: /PRPs/System/Methodology.md - Integrate decomposition guidelines into PRP creation and organization processes
- **Create**: /PRPs/System/Domain Decomposition Guide.md - Dedicated guide with examples and decision trees for domain decomposition

### Key Implementation Details

- Apply hierarchical structuring patterns from Task 02 to ensure decomposed domains maintain logical organizational relationships
- Integrate with knowledge categorization strategies from Task 04 to enable consistent classification of decomposed domain components
- Follow atomic knowledge unit principles ensuring decomposed domains maintain focused, single-responsibility boundaries

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Functional decomposition strategies documented with clear guidelines for capability-based and feature-based domain organization
- [ ] Technical decomposition approaches established for organizing domains by implementation layers and system architectures  
- [ ] User-centric decomposition methods created structuring domains around user goals and workflow patterns
- [ ] Process decomposition frameworks defined for organizing domains by business processes and operational sequences
- [ ] Decision framework created helping users select appropriate decomposition strategies based on domain characteristics
- [ ] Implementation examples provided demonstrating decomposition application across diverse complex domains

## Validation

### Verification Steps

1. Apply decomposition guidelines to existing complex domains and validate improved manageability and organization
2. Test decision framework with domain experts to verify appropriate decomposition strategy selection
3. Validate decomposed domain components maintain coherent relationships and enable effective context assembly

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Verify decomposition strategy documentation
grep -r "functional.*decomposition\|technical.*decomposition\|user.*centric\|process.*decomposition" PRPs/Domains/Knowledge\ Organization.md

# Check methodology integration
grep -r "decomposition.*guideline\|domain.*breakdown" PRPs/System/Methodology.md

# Validate decomposition guide creation
test -f "PRPs/System/Domain Decomposition Guide.md" && echo "Decomposition guide created"
```

### Success Indicators

- Complex domains can be systematically broken down into manageable components using documented decomposition strategies
- Decomposition decision framework enables consistent selection of appropriate strategies based on domain characteristics
- Decomposed domain components maintain coherent relationships while enabling focused development and maintenance
