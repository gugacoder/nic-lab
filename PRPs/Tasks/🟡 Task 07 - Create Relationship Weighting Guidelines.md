## Context

Intelligent context assembly requires systematic relationship weighting that quantifies the importance and strength of semantic connections to enable prioritized context building and cognitive load management. This task establishes comprehensive guidelines for assigning relationship weights including critical dependencies, supporting context, optional references, and contextual relevance with filtering strategies for optimized context assembly.

## Relationships

### Implements Feature

- **[[Semantic Linking Enhancement.md]]**: Provides relationship weighting systems that enable intelligent context prioritization and assembly optimization

### Impacts Domains

- **[[Semantic Relationships.md]]**: Enhanced with relationship weighting frameworks and strength indicator systems
- **[[AI Context Engineering.md]]**: Relationship weights will enable AI-optimized context assembly with cognitive load management

## Implementation

### Required Actions

1. Define strength indicator categories including critical dependencies, supporting context, optional references, and contextual relevance
2. Create systematic weighting assignment guidelines based on semantic relationship types and contextual importance
3. Establish filtering strategies using relationship weights to optimize context assembly for different goals and constraints
4. Document dynamic weighting approaches that adjust relationship strength based on current implementation focus and context

### Files to Modify/Create

- **Enhance**: /PRPs/Domains/Semantic Relationships.md - Add comprehensive relationship weighting frameworks with strength indicator definitions
- **Update**: /PRPs/System/Methodology.md - Integrate relationship weighting into context assembly algorithms and procedures
- **Create**: /PRPs/System/Relationship Weighting Guide.md - Dedicated guide for assigning and using relationship weights effectively

### Key Implementation Details

- Apply semantic relationship types from Task 05 to ensure weighting guidelines work consistently across different relationship semantics
- Integrate with AI context engineering principles from [[AI Context Engineering.md]] to optimize weighting for AI processing efficiency
- Build upon bidirectional relationship conventions from Task 06 to ensure weight consistency across reciprocal connections

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Strength indicator categories defined with clear criteria for critical, supporting, optional, and contextual relationship weights
- [ ] Systematic weighting assignment guidelines established based on semantic relationship types and contextual importance factors
- [ ] Filtering strategies implemented using relationship weights for optimized context assembly with cognitive load management
- [ ] Dynamic weighting approaches documented enabling context-sensitive relationship strength adjustment
- [ ] Integration completed with context assembly algorithms providing measurable improvements in context relevance and efficiency
- [ ] Validation mechanisms established ensuring relationship weight consistency across bidirectional connections

## Validation

### Verification Steps

1. Apply relationship weighting guidelines to existing semantic relationships and validate improved context assembly prioritization
2. Test filtering strategies with complex knowledge networks to verify cognitive load reduction while maintaining context completeness
3. Validate dynamic weighting approaches adjust appropriately based on different implementation focuses and contextual requirements

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Verify relationship weighting documentation
grep -r "strength.*indicator\|weight.*assignment\|critical.*supporting.*optional" PRPs/Domains/Semantic\ Relationships.md

# Check methodology integration
grep -r "relationship.*weight\|context.*priorit\|filtering.*strateg" PRPs/System/Methodology.md

# Validate weighting guide creation
test -f "PRPs/System/Relationship Weighting Guide.md" && echo "Relationship weighting guide created"
```

### Success Indicators

- Relationship weighting enables measurably more relevant context assembly compared to unweighted relationship traversal
- Filtering strategies successfully reduce cognitive load while preserving essential context completeness for task execution
- Dynamic weighting approaches provide context-sensitive relationship prioritization improving task-focused context assembly
