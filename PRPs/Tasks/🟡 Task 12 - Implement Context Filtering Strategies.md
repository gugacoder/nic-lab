## Context

AI processing efficiency requires intelligent context filtering that reduces cognitive load while preserving essential information for task completion. This task establishes comprehensive filtering strategies including need-based assembly, progressive disclosure, relevance scoring, and adaptive filtering that optimize context for specific AI capabilities and task requirements while preventing information overload.

## Relationships

### Implements Feature

- **[[AI Context Optimization.md]]**: Provides context filtering strategies that complete the AI context optimization framework

### Impacts Domains

- **[[AI Context Engineering.md]]**: Enhanced with systematic context filtering approaches and adaptive context management
- **[[Semantic Relationships.md]]**: Filtering strategies will leverage relationship weighting for intelligent context prioritization

## Implementation

### Required Actions

1. Define need-based assembly approaches including only context relevant to current implementation goals and task requirements
2. Create progressive disclosure mechanisms adding context layers as AI understanding deepens or task complexity increases
3. Establish relevance scoring systems prioritizing context elements based on task-specific importance and relationship strength
4. Implement adaptive filtering approaches adjusting context based on AI processing capabilities and feedback patterns

### Files to Modify/Create

- **Enhance**: /PRPs/Domains/AI Context Engineering.md - Add comprehensive context filtering strategies section with adaptive management frameworks
- **Update**: /PRPs/System/Methodology.md - Integrate context filtering strategies into context assembly algorithms with adaptive mechanisms
- **Create**: /PRPs/System/Context Filtering Strategies Guide.md - Dedicated guide for implementing and applying context filtering approaches

### Key Implementation Details

- Apply relationship weighting guidelines from Task 07 to enable filtering based on relationship strength and contextual importance
- Build upon information sequencing guidelines from Task 11 to ensure filtered context maintains logical understanding progression
- Integrate with AI context engineering principles from Task 09 to optimize filtering for cognitive load management

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Need-based assembly approaches implemented including only context relevant to specific implementation goals and task requirements
- [ ] Progressive disclosure mechanisms created adding context layers based on understanding depth and task complexity
- [ ] Relevance scoring systems established prioritizing context elements based on task importance and relationship strength
- [ ] Adaptive filtering approaches implemented adjusting context based on AI processing capabilities and performance feedback
- [ ] Integration completed with context assembly providing measurable improvements in processing efficiency without information loss
- [ ] Filtering validation mechanisms established ensuring essential context preservation while achieving cognitive load reduction

## Validation

### Verification Steps

1. Apply context filtering strategies to complex knowledge networks and measure processing efficiency improvements
2. Test progressive disclosure mechanisms with varying task complexity levels to validate appropriate context layer addition
3. Verify adaptive filtering maintains essential context completeness while achieving measurable cognitive load reduction

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Verify context filtering documentation
grep -r "need.*based\|progressive.*disclosure\|relevance.*scoring\|adaptive.*filtering" PRPs/Domains/AI\ Context\ Engineering.md

# Check methodology integration
grep -r "context.*filter\|filtering.*strateg\|adaptive.*context" PRPs/System/Methodology.md

# Validate filtering strategies guide creation
test -f "PRPs/System/Context Filtering Strategies Guide.md" && echo "Context filtering strategies guide created"
```

### Success Indicators

- Context filtering strategies enable 30% improvement in AI processing efficiency while maintaining 95% task completion accuracy
- Progressive disclosure successfully adapts context complexity to task requirements without overwhelming AI processing capabilities
- Adaptive filtering provides context optimization based on AI performance feedback resulting in improved task execution outcomes
