## Overview

[Provide a comprehensive conceptual overview of this domain. Explain what this area covers, its purpose, and its role in the overall system. Someone reading this section should understand the complete scope and importance of this domain without needing to dive into implementation details.]

## [Create Conceptual Sections]

[Design 2-4 conceptual sections appropriate for this specific domain. Each section should cover important conceptual aspects that help understand this domain. Use wikilinks [[Reference.md]] throughout the text to connect related concepts. Examples of section types to consider:]

[For technical domains: Architecture, Components, Data Flow, Integration Points]
[For business domains: Processes, Workflows, Business Rules, Stakeholders]  
[For user-facing domains: User Experience, Interaction Patterns, Use Cases]
[For system domains: System Design, Communication Patterns, Dependencies]

[Each section should:]
[- Explain key concepts clearly]
[- Include wikilinks to related features, tasks, or other domains]
[- Provide enough detail for conceptual understanding]
[- Avoid implementation specifics (those belong in features)]

## Features

[List and organize all features that belong to this domain. Group related features together if helpful. Each feature should be linked and briefly described:]

### [Feature Group Name (if applicable)]

- [[Feature Name 1.md]] - [Brief description of what this feature does]
- [[Feature Name 2.md]] - [Brief description of what this feature does]

### [Another Feature Group (if applicable)]

- [[Feature Name 3.md]] - [Brief description of what this feature does]
- [[Feature Name 4.md]] - [Brief description of what this feature does]

[If no grouping is needed, simply list features directly:]

- [[Feature Name.md]] - [Brief description]
- [[Feature Name.md]] - [Brief description]
