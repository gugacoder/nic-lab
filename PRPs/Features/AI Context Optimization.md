## Purpose

Implement AI-optimized context assembly and information architecture by applying context engineering principles, optimized formatting standards, strategic information sequencing, and intelligent context filtering that maximizes AI comprehension and task execution effectiveness while minimizing cognitive load and processing overhead.

## Scope

- Document and implement AI context engineering principles for optimal AI comprehension
- Establish optimized formatting standards that enhance AI parsing and understanding
- Create information sequencing guidelines that match AI processing patterns
- Implement context filtering strategies that reduce cognitive load while preserving essential information
- Integrate AI optimization principles with semantic relationship systems

## User Flow

1. **Context Requirements Definition**: User specifies task goals and AI processing requirements
2. **Intelligent Assembly**: System applies AI optimization principles to assemble relevant context
3. **Format Optimization**: Context is structured using AI-optimized formatting and sequencing patterns
4. **Adaptive Filtering**: System filters context based on AI processing capabilities and task-specific needs

**Success State**: AI receives optimally structured context that enables faster processing and more accurate task execution

**Error Handling**: Context assembly degradation strategies when optimization conflicts with completeness requirements
