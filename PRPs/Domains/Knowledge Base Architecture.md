## Overview

The Knowledge Base Architecture domain defines the organizational structure and access patterns for corporate knowledge stored across GitLab repositories and wikis. This domain establishes how information is categorized, indexed, searched, and retrieved to support AI-powered conversations and document generation. The architecture balances comprehensive coverage with query performance, enabling rapid access to relevant information while maintaining the flexibility to accommodate diverse content types and organizational structures.

## Information Organization

The knowledge base implements a multi-dimensional organization scheme that supports both hierarchical navigation and cross-cutting search patterns. Content is organized by project boundaries in GitLab while maintaining logical connections through tagging, cross-references, and semantic relationships.

Organization dimensions include:
- **Project Hierarchy**: GitLab project structure defines primary boundaries
- **Content Types**: Technical docs, policies, procedures, templates
- **Semantic Categories**: Topics, technologies, business domains
- **Temporal Aspects**: Version history, document lifecycle stages

## Indexing Strategy

The system maintains multiple specialized indexes optimized for different query patterns. Full-text search indexes support keyword queries, while semantic indexes enable concept-based retrieval. Metadata indexes facilitate filtering by attributes like author, date, or document type.

Index types include:
- **Full-Text Index**: Comprehensive content search capabilities
- **Semantic Index**: Concept and meaning-based retrieval
- **Metadata Index**: Structured attribute filtering
- **Relationship Graph**: Document interconnections and dependencies

## Search Capabilities

The knowledge base provides sophisticated search capabilities that go beyond simple keyword matching. Natural language queries are processed to understand intent, with the system selecting appropriate search strategies based on query characteristics. Results are ranked by relevance considering both content matches and contextual factors.

## Content Processing

Raw content from GitLab repositories undergoes processing to extract structured information and enhance searchability. Markdown parsing, metadata extraction, and content enrichment prepare documents for efficient retrieval. The [[Wiki Content Processor.md]] handles GitLab wiki pages while maintaining formatting and structure.
