## Overview

The Streamlit Interface domain encompasses the web-based user interface layer of the NIC Chat system. Built using Python's Streamlit framework, this domain provides an interactive, responsive interface that enables professionals to engage in AI-assisted conversations, explore knowledge bases, and manage document generation workflows. The interface prioritizes simplicity and efficiency, running on self-hosted infrastructure while providing a modern user experience comparable to cloud-based solutions.

## User Experience Design

The Streamlit interface implements a dual-pane layout pattern optimized for professional workflows. The primary chat interface occupies the main content area, providing a familiar conversational experience with the AI assistant. A secondary document preview pane allows real-time review of generated content before committing to the GitLab repository.

Key UX principles include:
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex features revealed only when needed
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate visual responses to user actions
- **Contextual Actions**: Relevant options presented based on conversation state
- **Professional Aesthetics**: Clean, corporate-friendly design language

## Component Architecture

The Streamlit application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation between presentation and business logic. Session state management ensures consistent user experience across interactions, while custom components extend Streamlit's capabilities for specialized document handling needs.

Core components include:
- **Chat Component**: Message history, input handling, and AI response display
- **Document Preview**: Real-time rendering of generated documents
- **Action Toolbar**: Context-sensitive buttons for document operations
- **Settings Panel**: Configuration options for AI behavior and output formats

## State Management

Streamlit's session state system manages application data persistence across user interactions. The state architecture implements a unidirectional data flow pattern, ensuring predictable behavior and simplified debugging. Critical state elements include conversation history, document drafts, GitLab connection status, and user preferences.
