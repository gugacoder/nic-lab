## Overview

The Document Generation System domain encompasses the complete pipeline for transforming AI-generated content into professional, formatted documents. Supporting both DOCX and PDF output formats with full image embedding capabilities, this system bridges the gap between conversational AI outputs and corporate documentation standards. The architecture prioritizes format fidelity, template flexibility, and seamless integration with existing document workflows while maintaining high performance for real-time preview generation.

## Document Architecture

The system implements a layered architecture separating content generation, formatting, and rendering concerns. AI-generated content flows through a standardized intermediate representation before being transformed into target formats. This approach enables consistent formatting across different output types while allowing format-specific optimizations.

Architecture layers include:
- **Content Layer**: Structured representation of document elements
- **Formatting Layer**: Style application and layout management  
- **Rendering Layer**: Format-specific output generation
- **Preview Layer**: Real-time visualization in the UI

## Format Support

The system provides comprehensive support for corporate documentation needs through two primary format engines. Python-docx handles Microsoft Word document generation with full formatting capabilities, while ReportLab manages PDF creation with precise layout control. Both engines support embedded images, tables, and complex formatting requirements.

Format capabilities include:
- **DOCX Generation**: Native Word documents with styles and templates
- **PDF Creation**: High-fidelity PDFs with custom layouts
- **Image Embedding**: Automatic image processing and placement
- **Template Support**: Corporate branding and standard formats

## Image Processing Pipeline

The [[Image Handling System.md]] integrates with the document generation pipeline to support various image sources and formats. Pillow provides image manipulation capabilities including resizing, format conversion, and optimization for document embedding. The system handles both AI-generated images and user-provided graphics.

## Template Management

Document templates define reusable formatting patterns aligned with corporate standards. The system supports dynamic template selection based on document type and purpose, with template inheritance for specialized variations. Templates control typography, spacing, headers/footers, and branding elements.
