## Overview

The NIC Chat System is a corporate AI platform that integrates with self-hosted GitLab repositories to enable professionals to explore knowledge bases, generate documents, and leverage AI assistance for content creation. Built as a fork of Open WebUI, this system provides a seamless interface between corporate knowledge repositories and the proprietary NIC LLM, enabling efficient document generation workflows with comprehensive review capabilities.

## System Architecture

The NIC Chat architecture follows a modular design pattern with clear separation of concerns between the user interface, integration layer, AI orchestration, and document generation subsystems. Each component communicates through well-defined APIs, ensuring maintainability and extensibility.

Key architectural components include:
- **Frontend Layer**: [[Streamlit Interface.md]] providing the chat and document review UI
- **Integration Layer**: [[GitLab Integration.md]] for repository access and version control
- **AI Layer**: [[AI Conversational System.md]] using Groq API with LangChain orchestration
- **Document Layer**: [[Document Generation System.md]] for creating DOCX/PDF outputs

## Data Flow

The system implements a request-response pattern where user queries flow through the Streamlit interface to the AI orchestration layer. The AI system queries the GitLab knowledge base through the python-gitlab API, processes the information using Groq's Llama-3.1 model, and returns contextual responses. Document generation requests trigger a separate pipeline that formats AI-generated content into professional documents with image support.

## Integration Points

The platform integrates with several external systems while maintaining data sovereignty on self-hosted infrastructure:

- **GitLab API**: Read/write access to repositories and wikis for knowledge base operations
- **Groq API**: External AI processing for natural language understanding and generation
- **Local File System**: Temporary storage for document generation and image processing
- **Corporate Network**: All communications except Groq API calls remain within the corporate network
