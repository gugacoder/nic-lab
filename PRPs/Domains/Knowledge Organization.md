## Overview

Knowledge Organization encompasses the modern principles and methodologies for structuring, categorizing, and organizing information in ways that maximize understanding, accessibility, and utility for both human and AI consumers. This domain establishes the foundational practices for creating coherent knowledge hierarchies, effective categorization systems, and scalable organizational patterns that enable efficient knowledge discovery and context assembly.

## Organizational Principles

### Hierarchical Structuring

Knowledge organization follows clear hierarchical patterns that establish parent-child relationships between concepts:

- **Domain Hierarchies**: High-level knowledge areas that contain specialized sub-domains
- **Conceptual Inheritance**: Child concepts inherit context and patterns from parent domains
- **Scope Boundaries**: Clear delineation of what knowledge belongs in each organizational unit
- **Cross-Domain References**: Strategic connections between related but separate knowledge areas

### Atomic Knowledge Units

Each piece of knowledge should be organized into atomic, focused units that serve single purposes:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each file addresses one specific knowledge area or concept
- **Self-Contained Context**: Units provide sufficient context to be understood independently
- **Composable Elements**: Atomic units can be combined to create comprehensive understanding
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Reduce coupling while maintaining necessary relationships

## Categorization Strategies

### Domain Decomposition

Complex knowledge areas are systematically broken down into manageable components:

- **Functional Decomposition**: Breaking systems by what they do
- **Technical Decomposition**: Organizing by implementation layers or technologies
- **User-Centric Decomposition**: Structuring around user goals and workflows
- **Process Decomposition**: Organizing by business or operational processes

### Knowledge Classification

Information is classified using consistent taxonomies that enable discovery:

- **Topic Taxonomies**: Hierarchical classification by subject matter
- **Complexity Levels**: Organization by difficulty or sophistication level
- **Implementation Phases**: Sequencing by development or deployment order
- **Priority Classifications**: Organizing by importance or urgency

## Pattern Recognition

### Recurring Structures

Identify and document patterns that appear across different knowledge areas:

- **Architectural Patterns**: Common structural approaches that can be reused
- **Process Patterns**: Repeatable workflows and methodologies
- **Integration Patterns**: Standard approaches for connecting different systems
- **Error Handling Patterns**: Consistent approaches to managing failures and exceptions

### Template Abstractions

Create reusable templates that capture common organizational structures:

- **Domain Templates**: Standardized formats for different types of knowledge areas
- **Relationship Templates**: Patterns for linking related concepts
- **Workflow Templates**: Structured approaches for common processes
- **Validation Templates**: Standardized quality checking approaches
